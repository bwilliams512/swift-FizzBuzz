/*
Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked/referenced so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!

Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5%
programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.

This program outputs numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of 3, it prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, it prints Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints FizzBuzz.

var counter = 1

while counter <= 100 {

    print("FizzBuzz")
